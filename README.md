# Minimal Stream

A simple, responsive WordPress theme that includes:

- A helpful 404 template.
- Keyboard navigation for image attachment templates. The script can be found in js/keyboard-navigation.js. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
- A script at js/small-menu.js that makes your menu a toggled dropdown on small screens (like your phone), ready for CSS artistry. It’s enqueued in functions.php.
- The GPL license in license.txt. :) Use it to make something cool.
